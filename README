WHAT IS IT?
-----------

Xbase64 is an xbase (i.e. dBase, FoxPro, etc.) compatible C++ class library 
originally by Gary Kunkel and others (see the AUTHORS file).

Xbase64 is useful for accessing data in legacy dBase 3 and 4 database files as
well as a general light weight database engine.  It includes support for
DBF (dBase version 3 and 4) data files, NDX and MDX indices and DBT (dBase version 3 and 4).
It supports file and record locking under *nix and Windows.

Xbase64 is designed from the ground up to compile and run on any platform with a C++ compiler.
