How to modify the library:


The library was redesigned with a structure in mind to allow additional
dbf, memo and index files to be added relatively easily without trashing
the underlying codebase.


To add functionality to add a DBF, or tailor a particular dbf class,
create a new derived class using the xbdbf class as a base class.  
The core xbdbf base class encompasses the DBASE III code base.

At one time there was "Real Delete" processing embedded in the code. It 
was removed from the core classes because it would be incompatible with 
later versions of the xbase file structures.  If you were interested in
adding this back into the library, you could derive a new dbf class 
and add the mods into the new derived class, leaving the base class
as it stands.


To add additional memo functionality, create a new derived class from 
the xbMemo class.
