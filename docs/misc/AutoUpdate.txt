Auto Update Design / Functionality


Auto update functionality in the library is used to automatically update 
records in tables, when the user moves off a particular record without
explicitly posting an update for the new data updates.

The auto Update logic defaults to ON, and there is nothing that the
end user needs to worry about.

However, if it is desired to change the behavior of the library, the 
Auto Update logic can be turned off.

There are two levels to the Auto Update logic.

The first level is the DBMS level, which controls how all tables are
handled, if the Auto Update logic is not over ridden at the table level.

The second level is the table level.  The DBMS Auto Update logic can
be over ridden at the table level.


For the DBMS level settings, see methods:
    xBase::GetDefaultAutoUpdate
    xBase::SetDefaultAutoUpdate

At the DBMS level, there are two settings
   xbFalse = AutoUpdate is off
   xbTrue  = AutoUpdate is on

For the Table level settings, see methods:
    xbDbf::SetAutoUpdate
    xbDbf::GetAutoUpdate

At the table level, there are three settings
    -1  = Use the DBMS setting (this is the default)
     0  = Do not use Auto Update on this table
     1  = Use Auto Update on this table.

These seetings would be for a more advanceed implementation of
XBase64.  For the most part, you can ignore these settings and
use the defaults that are already set in the library and you should
be OK.
