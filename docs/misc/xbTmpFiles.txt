At times, the Xbase64 library will create temporary work files with the
following naming pattern:  xbtmpNNN.xxx  Where NNN is a sequential 
number and xxx is either dbf, dbt, ndx, mdx.

These files should be automatically deleted by the library when 
the task is complete.  However, if the program crashes in a particular
step, the temp files might not be cleaned up automatically.

If you run into these files, and they have an older timestamp on them,
it is safe to delete them.
