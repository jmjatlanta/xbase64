<hr><h2>Overview</h2>

Welcome to Xbase64 DBMS, a collection of specifications, programs, 
utilities and a C++ class library for manipulating legacy Xbase (DBF) type
data files and indices.
<br><br>

The term Xbase is often used used to describe the format of the original 
dBASE, Clipper and Foxbase (.DBF) files.   The XBase file format is well
documented and has stood the test of time.  Various popular programs
still create and read xbase formatted files.<br><br>
 
The purpose of the Xbase64 library is to provide reliable and usable
programming tools for reading, writing and updating DBF databases, 
indices and memo fields.  Version 4.x.x has been tested for compatability
with dBASE III and dBASE IV version data files and indices 
*.DBF (data), *.NDX (single tag index), *.MDX (multi tag index) and
*.DBT (memo).<br><br>

Version 4.x.x is a major rewrite of the library to strengthen error
processing and bring consistency across modules.  It includes updates
to the locking process and also includes a module to support MDX multi
tag indices.<br><br>

Earlier versions of the library have included NTX and CDX index formats 
and that code will be re-incorporated into the latest version in the 
future.


<br><br>
<B>Why use the Xbase library? </B>
The DBF file format is a ubiquitous industry standard with
widespread usage and application.  Using this standard file format removes any 
<em>vender specific</em> locks that bind you to a particular platform.
Additionally, with Xbase64 only the options needed can be compiled into or out of the library
to provide a custom configuration specific to project requirements.
For a small footprint, locking, memo fields and indices could be excluded from
the library build which would reduce the library size.
This tool is usefull for small to medium sized apps that don't need all the 
overhead, sophistication and cost of a complex client server configuration.
The Xbase library is designed to be flexible in which options can be compiled
into or out of the library and also which environments it can be run on.<br><br>
Xbase64 is designed to compile and run on most any platform or architecture with a 
supporting C++ compiler.



<br><br>
<h3>Library Features</h3>
<li>Supports 32 and 64 bit architectures
<li>Supports big endian and little endian architectures
<li>Compatible code, same API across multiple platforms / archtiectures
<li>Supports single and multi user configurations with record and file locking
<li>Includes support for logfiles



<br><br><br>

<hr><h2>System Requirements</h2>

To build the Xbase64 library, the following items are needed:<br><br>

A computer, a C/C++ compiler and CMAKE.<br><br>

The original source code was developed on a Linux platform with the GCC  
public domain C/C++ compiler. 
<br><br>

Xbase64 DBMS has been successfully ported and runs on Linux, Mac and Windows.
<br><br>

<hr><h2>Classes and User Interface</h2>

<a href="..\doxygen\html\index.html">Classes and User Interface Documentation via Doxygen</a>

<br><br>
<hr><h2>Portability, Type Defs and Structures</h2>

To make the Xbase64 library as portable as possible, the following things occurred:
<br><br>
<li>The software was developed to compile and run on either 32 or 64 bit architectures.
<li>The software was developed to compile and run on either big endian or little endian archtectures.
<li>All numeric data is stored in little endian format.
<li>The library is built using <a href="https://cmake.org">Cmake</a> to provide support on a wide variety of platforms.
<li>Field types were defined to be consistent across various OS and CPU configurations.
Xbase64 defines the following field types:<br><br><br>

<TABLE BORDER>
<CAPTION ALIGN=TOP><h3>Field Types</h3></CAPTION>
<TR ALIGN=BASELINE>
<TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>Type<TD>Description
<TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>xbBool<TD>Contains xbTrue (0)  or xbFalse (1)
<TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>xbInt16<TD>16 bit int
<TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>xbUInt16<TD>16 bit unsigned int
<TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>xbInt32<TD>32 bit int

<TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>void<TD>void
<TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>struct SCHEMA<TD>Used for defining record structures
</TABLE></CENTER>
<br><br>

Xbase64 was designed for portability utilizing standard ANSI-C/C++ compliant 
code.  If you decide to write updates to the Xbase64 project, please try
to keep your work to standard C/C++ generic calls and use the above predefined field types.<br><br>

<hr><h2>Compilation Overview</h2>
To build the xbase64 library, verify you have:<br>
<li>Xbase64 source code
<li>cmake 2.6 or LATER
<li>Compiler and linker

<br><br>
If you run into issues, verify you have access rights to the target location of the library.

<br><br>
For Linux:
<br><br>
<li>cd build/linux64   or  cd build/linux32
<li>cmake .
<li>make
<li>make test
<li>sudo make install
<li>Verify the ld.so.conf file has the library target directory. For example
update file /etc/ld.so.conf to include /usr/local/lib and run ldconfig.
<br><br>

For Mac:
<br><br>
<li>Verify you have xcode installed and operational.
<li>cd build/mac64
<li>cmake . -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.11.sdk
<li>make
<li>make test
<br><br>

For Windows 64 bit with Visual Studio:
<br><br>
<li>Open a Visual Studio 64 bit Shell
<li>cd build\win64vs
<li>buildwin.bat
<li>nmake test
<li>From a VS Studio 64 bit shell in admin mode:  nmake install
<br><br>

For Windows 32 bit with Visual Studio:
<br><br>
<li>Open a Visual Studio 32 bit Shell
<li>cd build\win32vs
<li>buildwin.bat
<li>nmake test
<li>From a VS Studio 32 bit shell in admin mode:  nmake install
<br><br>

For Windows 32 bit with Borland 5.5 free compiler
<br><br>
<li>cd build\borland5.5
<li>BuildBorland.bat
<li>make test
<li>make install (if errors, run in administrator mode)
<li>xb_cfg_check (if errors, add path c:\Program Files\xbase64\bin)

<br><br>

For other platforms:
<br><br>
Here is something to start with...
<li>cd xbase
<li>md MyPlatform
<li>cd MyPlatform
<li>cp ../Cmake/CmakeLists.txt.
<li>Enter the appropriate make command for your environment. Check the cmake web site for help.<br>
  On Linux, it is .cmake, then make
  your mileage may vary

  Send your results to the library maintainer so it can be added to this library



To use the Xbase classes, include the following header file in the program:
<br><br>

#include &lt;xbase.h&gt;<br><br>
