<br><br>
The <em>XBase64</em> library is a cross platform object oriented C++ set of classes for
accessing and manipulating the following Xbase file types:<br><br>


<table border=1>
<tr><th>Extension</th><th>Description</th><th>Supported by Xbase64 library?</th></tr>
<tr><td>*.DBF</td><td>Main DBF file or table name</td><td><center>Y</center></td></tr>
<tr><td>*.DBT</td><td>Verson 3 or Version 4 memo file</td><td><center>Y</center></td></tr>
<tr><td>*.NDX</td><td>Single tag index file</td><td><center>Y</center></td></tr>
<tr><td>*.MDX</td><td>Multi tag index file</td><td><center>Y</center></td></tr>
<tr><td>*.INF</td><td>ODBC file used for auto open of NDX files</td><td><center>Y</center></td></tr>
<tr><td>*.NTX</td><td>Clipper indexfile </td><td><center>Future</center></td></tr>
<tr><td>*.CDX</td><td>Fox Pro indexfile </td><td><center>Future</center></td></tr>
<tr><td>*.IDX</td><td>Fox Pro index file</td><td><center>Future</center></td></tr>
</table>




<br><br>

DBF files are comprised of a variable length header record which stores
information about the file and describes he fixed length record format, 
followed by a series of fixed length data records.
<br><br>

Each fixed length data record is preceded by a one byte indicator
which identifies if the record has been deleted.  If the record is
not deleted, the indicator is a space (0x20). If deleted, the
indicator contains an asterisk (0x2A).  Data fields are stored in records
without field separators or record terminators.<br><br>

In earlier releases of dBASE, there is an ASCII NULL character
between the $0D end of header indicator and the start of the data.
This NULL was removed starting with dBASE III Plus, making a Plus
header one byte shorter than an identically structured III file.
The methods documented in the Xbase software and documentation follow 
the more recent version where the NULL character is not included.
<br><br>

Each database file is comprised of zero, one or many records.  A record is
comprised of fields.  Only one record is accessed at a time.<br><br>

Zero, one or many database files can be open simultaneously.<br><br>

<hr>

<h3>The Record Buffer</h3>

When using the Xbase routines, each open data file has a record buffer 
which is manipulated by calling the database, index and field routines.
<br><br>

If <i>AutoCommit</i> is turned on (Default), updates are committed from 
the record buffer to the database when a write, or append is performed.
The library automatically writes updates to the database if the buffer has 
been updated and the record is repositioned or the database is closed.
<br><br>

If <i>AutoCommit</i> is turned off, updates will need to be explicity
committed to the database file with one of <i>dbf->Put(), dbf->Append()
or dbf->Commit()</i> command depending on context..  
Updates can be cancelled with the <i>Abort()</i> command.
<br><br>
The record buffer is not used for handling the actual data portion of 
memo fields.  When working with memo fields, the application program must
allocate enough buffer space for reading and writing memo fields or use
the xbString class for handling memo data.<br><br>

Internal to the library, there is an additional record buffer which
stores the original value of the data record before any changes are made.
This is used by the index routines for finding and deleting original key
values from any open indices before adding the new keys. If the key values
are not changed, no index updates occur. Additionally, calling the Abort()
method will back out any updates to the record buffer.

<h3>Xbase Database File Header - DBF Version III and Version IV</h3>

The Xbase file header, located at the beginning of the database, describes 
the .DBF database.  Knowledge of this structure is not necessary to 
effectively utilize the Xbase64 libraries.<br><br><br>

<h3>Xbase Field Descriptor Record</h3>
The Xbase field descriptor record stores information about each field in the
database.  Each database has from 1 to 1024 fields.  
Knowledge of this structure is not necessary to 
effectively utilize the Xbase libraries.<br><br><br>

<h3>Memo Fields</h3>

Memo fields store variable length data elements in a seperate .DBT file.
The main .DBF file maintains a ten byte field which is used by the Xbase
routines for determining the location of the data in the .DBT file.
<br><br>

Xbase DBMS supports both dBASE III+ and dBASE IV version memo files.
The version IV files are somewhat more efficient in that they reuse
unused memo space when data are deleted or freed from use.  With version
III files, all new updates are appended to the end of the file and the 
unused space is not reclaimed until the datafiles are packed.
<br><br>

Memo fields can be used for storing a variety of date type.  However,
type 3 files are limited to storing textual data because most internal
memo field processing in a type 3 file relies on two contiguous 0x1a
charaters.  <br><br>

Type 4 memo fields can be used for storing BLOB (binary large object)
data reliably, as the internal file structure does not rely on any 
special characters embedded in the data.<br><br>


<h3>Technical memo file information</h3>

The following info on memo fields is for the curious.
It is not required
reading if you don't need to know the internals.<br><br>

<li>Memo files are made up of one or more blocks
<li>For version III files, the block size is 512
<li>For version IV files, the block size is a multiple of 512
<li>The minimum amout of space necessary to store one memo field is 
one block or 512 bytes.
<li>The default block size can be adjusted by manipulating the 
XB_DBT_BLOCK_SIZE macro in the options.h file.


<li>The main .DBF file maintains a ten byte numeric field which is blank if 
no memo data exists for a given field. Otherwise it contains a number, which
when multiplied by the block size, points to the offset in the file of the head 
block in the file/
<br><br>

For version 3 memo field files, there are two fields in the head block of
the file, <em>NextBlockNo</em> and <em>Version</em>.  Depending on the 
Xbase software, some vendors products update these two fields, some do not.
The Xbase library keeps the fields updated, but does not rely on them to
be valued with correct data.  This helps to support maximum compatibility
amoungst all Xbase tools available.<br><br>

For version 4 memo field files,
the first block in the .DBT file is a header block which is comprised of
8 bytes of data which maintain the file's block size and the next free
block available in the file.  Blocks two through n contain the actual
memo data. A chain of empty blocks is maintained within the file for 
potential future use.  When an add or update routine executes, it first 
attempts to find a spot in a set of blocks which were earlier allocated,
but not currently in use for the data. If no free spot is found, data are 
appended to the end of the file.

The free block chain is sorted in block number order.  When blocks of
data are freed and added to the free block chain, the routines will attempt
to concatonate free block chains togethor where possible. When a delete
occurs, or an update which requires less space occurs, the new free space 
is added to the free block chain.

<h3>Block Reads</h3>

As of release 4.1.1, the Xbase library includes functionality for reading a DBF file in blocks, rather than one record at a time.<br><br>

This functionality can be used to improve application performance in situations where a data file is being read sequentially.
For situations where records are retrieved randomly from the file, enabling this probably won't help much.  In short, this 
can be turned on when accessing a file sequentially and should be left off when not processing sequentially.<br><br>

The logic is handled internally within the library, all that is needed is to 
enable it and the library handles the rest.  Additionally, the block read functionality 
was designed with for sequential file access and is designed with reporting in mind. 
It doesn't currently have any auto locking associated with it.
<br><br>

To enable and disable Block Reading for a DBF file, use 
<em>xbDbf::EnableBlockReadProcessing()</em>
and <em>xbDbf::DisableBlockReadProcessing()</em>.
<br><br>

<h3>Locking Overview</h3>

Xbase64 supports multi-user processing through file and record locks.
Record locking restricts multiple cooperating programs from simultaneously 
accessing the same data and corrupting it. Without record and file locking 
in a multi-user environment, simultaneous access to the data and index files
can cause the files to become inaccurate and unusable.<br><br>

Automatic record locking is on by default in the Xbase64 library. To disable it,
use method xbXBase::DisableDefaultAutoLock() and to enable it, use method xbXBase::EnableDefaultAutoLock().
<br><br>
Locking can also be enabled / disabled at the table level with with xbDbf::SetAutoLock().<br><br>
If autolocking is disabled and the code base is being used in a multi user environment, it is 
up to the application program to verify the needed locks are set as there is no checking or
setting any locks if autolocking is turned off.  It is only safe to turn off the autolocking functionality
if the library is being used in a single user environment.

<br><br>
The current Xbase64 record locking logic is modeled after DBase (tm) V7 locking.
<br><br>

The locking methods return either XB_LOCK_FAILED or XB_NO_ERROR.  If they return
XB_LOCK_FAILED the actual reason can be found in the global variable 
<em>errno</em> or function <em>perror()</em> can be executed to view the
results.
<br><br>

The errno field may contain one of the following values if the lock was not
successful.<br><br>

<h3>Linux/Windows File Locking Compatibility Issue</h3>

There is a compatibility locking issue to be aware of.   Windows environments allow for the exclusive 
opening of file handles and Linux/Unix platforms do not.  If you are writing an application that will be
using a tool like Dbase on a Windows machine, accessing a file on a Linux/Samba configure machine,
be aware that the file could be opened in exclusive mode by DBase on the Windows system, and the same file could 
be simultaneously opened with a program on the Unix box.  That could cause some issues.

<br><br>
In Unix, a program can not lock a file so another process can not access it.<br>
In Windows, a program can lock a file so another process can not access it.<br>
DBase(tm) supports routines to open files exclusively, preventing other users from opening a file.<br>
Locking on the Mac/Apple platform only works on NFS shares.  It does not work with SMB shares.

<br><h3>Samba settings</h3>

If you will be using Samba on Linux/Unix and sharing files between Linux and Windows machines, 
you will need to disable oplocks. In the smb.conf file, set:<br>
<br>
[sharename]<br>
oplocks = False<br>
level2 oplocks = False

<br><br>There is a known issue with Samba and Windows 7.  Xbase64 runs very slow on Windows 7 
connecting to a Samba Server.  If you know how to resolve this, please send an email to support. Thanks.
<br><br>


<br><h3>iLockFlavor</h3>

The library was constructed in a manner so that it could be updated to support alternate lock "flavors".
The 4.x.x library is built to mirror the DBase locking, but the structure is in place to expand to other locking 
types if needed.
