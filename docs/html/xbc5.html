<H1><p align="center">Index Overview</p></H1>
<p align="center">Chapter Updated 09/01/24</p><hr>

The objective of this chapter is to provide information regarding 
the basic concepts of index processing for the Xbase library.<br><br>


<h3>Overview</h3>

The Xbase64 library is designed to support multiple index types simultaneously.
dBASE, Clipper and Foxbase each had their own index formats and ultimately the
goal is to provide support for all the legacy index file formats.

<br><br>
The 4.0.x rewrite includes the NDX and MDX formats.  Earlier versions of the
library included an NTX format which will be brought forward into the
library rewrite at some point in the future.


<h3>Tags</h3>

Each index file contains one or more tags depending on the file type.  Each tag is a sort order 
and has characteristics:  Sort order (ASC or DESC), unique or not unique and some formats support filtering. 
Each open table (dbf file) has an "active tag" for database operations.

<h3>Index processing design</h3>

The library is construcuted to handle index files with multiple tags per file.  Single tag files like the NDX indices
are treated as a multi tag file, but there is only one tag.  This allows for maximum flexibility for future
additional index types.


<br><br>
Version 4.1.8 of the library introduced enhanced index processing to support either legacy dBASE compatibility or 
enhanced logic for deleted records, unique keys and tag page recycling.

    <td>DBase compatibility mode</td>
    <td>Deleted records kept in the index</td>

</tr>

</table>
</center>

<br><br>
<li>XB_IX_DBASE_MODE is the default setting.<br>
<li>XB_IX_XBASE_MODE is not compatible with other XBase or dBASE related tools.  It is specific to the XBase64 library only.
<li>The two modes are not compatible.<br>
<li>When switching modes on a preexisting index, you will need to reindex.
<li>If switching to XB_IX_XBASE_MODE, you will need to reindex with the Xbase64 library version.
If the tag is defined as unique and multiple records with the same key exist, the reindex routine will 
throw a XB_KEY_NOT_UNIQUE error.
<li>If switching to XB_IX_DBASE_MODE, you are not limited to the XBase64 library version for reindexing.
<li>The mode setting is not stored in the physical index file.  It needs to be handled by your program 
in some other manner.
<li>This is a tag specific setting meaning different tags can be set to operate in different modes.
<li>The mode is designed to be set one way or the other for the entire lifespan of the tag.  It's not designed
to be switched back and forth.

<br><br>
<center>
<h4>Methods for getting/setting the mode</h4>

<tr><td>xbIx::SetIxTagMode( void *vpTag, XB_IX_DBASE_MODE ||<br> XB_IX_XBASE_MODE )</td><td>Set the mode for the specified tag</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<br><br>
<h3>Index updates</h3>

The library automatically updates all tags in all open index files.


<h3>Unique Indices / Unique Keys</h3>

With the original dBASE software, if the database (DBF) file contains more than one record with the same
resultant key value and a given index was defined as unique, the DBF database file is updated with the
record containing the duplicate key, but the index (tag) only contains a reference to the first record in the file
for the given key.
<br><br>

The Xbase64 library is designed to support the legacy dBASE methododology for handling unique keys
in addition to being able to throw an error and not update the DBF database file if attempting to add a unique key.
if the XB_IX_XBASE_MODE is set.


<br><br>
<h3>Deleted Records</h3>

With the original dBASE software, deleting a record did not actually delete a record from the DBF database file.
Instead of physically removing the record from the file, the record is flagged with an "*" in the first byte of the record 
and the record is available to be "undeleted" at a later point.
Additionally, the orginal dBASE Software does not delete the index values from a given tag if the 
record is flagged for deletion.
<br><br>
To physically remove records flagged for deletion from the DBF file, execute the <em>xbDbf::Pack()</em> method.

<br><br>
For the MDX style indices, deleted records can be filtered out by adding a filter of ".NOT. DELETED()" to the key definition.
<br><br>

For the NDX style indices, filter logic does not exist.  One
possible way to address deleted records in a given NDX index would be to add the delete flag to the key structure and 
filter out deleted records using the actual key value.  For example, you could have a key expression defined as  
<em>DELETED()+MYFIELD</em>,  or alternatively  <em>MYFIELD+DELETED()</em>.
<br><br>

Setting the mode to XB_IX_XBASE_MODE will remove index entries when the corresponding dbf record is deleted.

<h2>NDX Indices</h2>
The objective of this section is to provide information regarding the
basic concepts of how .NDX index files work in the Xbase64 library.
Information in this section has been acquired by searching the internet
and by examining the structure of known good NDX indexes.<br><br>

<h4>NDX Index File Characteristics</h4>

<li>NDX indices maintain keys in ascending sort order only.<br><br>
<li>NDX indices support <em>unique</em> or <em>non unique</em> keys.<br><br>

<em>Unique</em> keys must be unique.
If the UniqueKeyOption is set to XB_EMULATE_DBASE, then the database update routines will 
allow all records to be added to the table, but not add a corresponding duplicate key to the index tag.
Set the UniqueKeyOpt to XB_HALT_ON_DUPKEYS if you want the library to to not add duplicate
records to a file for a given key value.  Keep in mind that deleted records are also 
kept in the NDX index file.
<br><br>

<em>Non-unique</em> Keys are not required to be unique, duplicate
keys are allowed if the index is created with the XB_NOT_UNIQUE
setting.  Duplicate keys are stored in record number order.<br><br>

<li>NDX indexes are automatically updated by the Xbase library after the
indices are opened.<br>
<li>Character keys are left justified and padded on the right with spaces.<br>
<li>Numeric keys are stored as eight byte double values.<br>
<li>Date kets are stored as julian eight byte double values.<br>

<h4>NDX File Internals</h4>

NDX files are comprised of two or more 512 byte blocks or nodes of 
information.  There are three types of nodes: Head Nodes, Interior
Nodes and Leaf Nodes.<br><br>

<li>The <em>Head Node</em> is the first node in the file starting at 
position zero (0) and contains information about the NDX file. There
is only one Head Node in each index and it always starts at the
beginning of the file.<br><br>

<xmp>
   struct NdxHeadNode{
      xbLong   StartNode;             /* header node is node 0       */
      xbLong   TotalNodes;            /* includes header node        */
      xbLong   NoOfKeys;              /* actual count + 1            */
      xbUShort KeyLen;                /* length of key data          */
      xbUShort KeysPerNode;           /* max number of keys per node */
      xbUShort KeyType;               /* 00 = Char, 01 = Numeric     */
      xbLong   KeySize;               /* KeyLen + 8                  */
      char     Reserved1;             /* Not sure about this one     */
      char     Unique;                /* 00 = not unique, 01 = unique*/
      char     KeyExpression[488];    /* key definition              */
   }
</xmp>
<br><br>

<h4>Interior and Leaf Nodes</h4>

Interior Nodes and Leaf Nodes share the same structure in an NDX file.
The difference between the two types is that interior nodes point to
other interior nodes or leaf nodes and leaf nodes point to records in 
a DBF file.   Interior nodes are optional nodes in an NDX file,
however if there are more than a few keys in the index there will 
certainly be one or more interior nodes in the file.  There will 
always be at least one leaf node in the file.  Leaf nodes contain DBF
record numbers which point to the location of the record in the
DBF file.<br><br>

Interior nodes have field LeftNodeNo valued which points to the node
which points to the keys which are less than the key value in the KeyVal
field.  There is one more LeftNodeNo value in the node than there are keys.
The Last LeftNodeNo points to the node which is greater than the highest
key value in the node.  Interior nodes have 0 in the value for the
DbfRecNo field.<br><br>

Leaf nodes have 0 in the LeftNodeNo field but do have a value in the 
DbfRecNo field which points to a DFB record.<br><br>

</TABLE>

<br><br>
For those interested in knowing how the Xbase64 DBMS manipulates and
navigates index files, the following discussion may be helpful.<br><br>

Xbase64 DBMS navigates through NDX files by using an in-memory chain
of nodes of the current location / key in use.  It starts by reading the 
Head Node of the index, which points to the first node of the file. The
first node of the file will be a leaf node if the index is small or will 
be an interior node if the index has more than one leaf node.  The first
interior node is loaded into memory, added to the node chain and points 
to the next node to read.  The node is made up of one or more keys.  If
it is a leaf node, the logic looks for a matching key on the node.
Otherwise, if it is an interior node, the logic looks at the keys until the 
search key is greater than or equal to the key in the node and then 
traverses down the tree to the next node.  It continues down the tree,
adding the nodes to the in-memory node chain until it reaches the correct
leaf node. If it finds a matching key in the leaf node, it returns a
XB_FOUND condition.  If it doesn't find an exact match in the leaf node, it
returns a XB_NOT_FOUND condition and stops on the key which is greater than
the search key given.

<h2>MDX Indices</h2>
The objective of this section is to provide information regarding the
basic concepts of how .MDX index files work in the Xbase64 library.<br>
Information for MDX files has been gathered by searching the internet
and by examining the structure of known good MDX index files.<br><br>

<h4>MDX Index File Characteristics</h4>

<li>MDX files are the same name as the corresponding DBF file with an MDX extension.
<li>MDX files are automatically opened by the library when the DBF file is opened.
<li>MDX index files (aka prod indices) contain from one to 47 tags, where each tag has it's own key characteristics.
<li>MDX indices maintain keys in either ascending or descending sort order.
<li>MDX indices support filtered keys.  For example, a filter of <b>.NOT. DELETED()</b> will keep deleted records out
of the index tag.
<li>MDX indices are automatically updated by the Xbase library after the
indices are opened.
<li>MDX indices support <em>unique</em> or <em>non unique</em> keys.<br><br>

<em>Unique</em> keys must be unique if the UniqueKeyOption is not set to XB_EMULATE_DBASE.
If the UniqueKeyOption is set to XB_EMULATE_DBASE, then the database update routines will 
add a record to the table, but not add a corresponding duplicate key to the index tag.
The UniqueKeyOption is off (don't allow duplicates) by default.
<br><br>

<em>Non-unique</em> Keys are not required to be unique, duplicate
keys are allowed if the index is created with the XB_NOT_UNIQUE
setting.  Duplicate keys are stored in record number order.<br><br>


<li>Character keys are left justified and padded on the right with spaces.
<li>Numeric keys are stored as twelve byte BCD values.
<li>Date keys are stored as eight byte double julian values.

<h4>MDX File Internals</h4>

The following information is not needed to use the library, it is just included
for general information.<br><br>

MDX files are comprised of 512 pages where multiple pages make a block.  The default 
setting is 1024 blocks, each block containing two pages.<br><br>

The first four pages contain:
<li>Bytes 0 - 543 contain general file information.
<li>Bytes 544 - 2047 is a 47 item table containing specific tag information.
<br><br>

Pages five and beyound:
<li>Bytes 2048 and beyond contain tag header blocks, interior nodes and leaf nodes.

<br><br>

<h4>Interior and Leaf Nodes</h4>

Interior Nodes and Leaf Nodes share the same structure in an NDX file with 
the exception that interior nodes have a non zero number immediately
after the rightmost key on the node.

Interior nodes point to other interior nodes or leaf nodes and leaf nodes point 
to records in a DBF file.   Interior nodes are optional nodes in an MDX file,
however if there are more than a few keys in the index there will 
certainly be one or more interior nodes in the file.  There will 
always be at least one leaf node per tag in the file.  Leaf nodes 
contain DBF record numbers which point to the location of the record 
in the DBF file.<br><br>

<hr>
<br><br>
<h2>TDX Indices</h2>
TDX index files are an Xbase64 library specific implementation of indexing which
can be used for creating temporary indices.  They can be created as needed and are
automatically deleted when the table/DBF file is closed.<br><br>

TDX files are built on the MDX index logic and supports the following functionality:
<li>Complex Key Expressions
<li>Filters
<li>Unique / Non-unique keys
<li>Ascending / Descending keys
<li>Max of 47 unique temporary index tags
<br><br>

To create a temporary index, set the Type field to "TDX" when using the xbDbf::CreateTag() method.
All other functionality is the same when using temp indices.  The only requirement is to set the
type when creating it.<br><br>

Additionally, the create tag only defines the index.  If the table is populated with data and
you need the index populated accordingly, use the xbDbf::Reindex() method to bring it up to data after 
creating it.
