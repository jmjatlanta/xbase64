<h3>INF File Details.</h3>



<li>INF support is used to automatically open .NDX index files at table open time.  Production MDX index files are opened
automaticially at DBF file open time, but NDX index files are not.  Using the INF option causes the
NDX index file to be automatically opened.
<br><br>

<li>Xbase64 INF support uses the same format of the INF files as created by the MS ODBC drivers for compatibility.
<br><br>

<li>INF support requires the XB_INF_SUPPORT option be enabled at compile time.
<br><br>

<li>Use method <em>xbDbf::AssociateIndex()</em> to update an INF file in your application program.
<br><br>

<li>When using the SQL module, use the <em>ASSOCIATE</em> modifier to update the INF file.<br><br>

Example: CREATE INDEX ZipCode.NDX ON ZipCode.DBF( ZIPCODE ) <em>ASSOCIATE;</em><br><br>

The above Create command results in an INF file with the name of ZipCode.INF to be created with the following
contents:<br><br>

<xml>
[dBASE]<br>
NDX=ZipCode3.NDX
</xml>
<br><br>
