<br><br>
The main objective of this chapter is to provide basic information regarding 
various field types supported by the library.<br><br>

Field names can be up to ten bytes in length and can contain characters, numbers
or special characters in the name.  The field methods are used to manipulate
the data in a record of a data file.  There are several types of fields.<br><br>

</TABLE>

<br><br>
Field names, types and lengths are defined when a data file is created.  
After the file is created, the field characteristics can not be changed. To
change field characteristics, a new database table must be defined with the new
field requirements.<br><br>

<h3>Memo Fields</h3>

Memo fields are variable length data fields which are stored in two parts.
This first part is a ten byte field which is stored 
in the fixed length record of the .DBF file.  The variable data is stored in
a seperate .DBT file in 512 byte blocks.  The ten byte field in the fixed 
length portion of the record points to a .DBT block number.<br><br>

There are two versions of memo data files type III and type IV.  Type IV
is more advanced in that released space can be reused and it also
supports BLOB data.  The type III file is older technology, does not
support dynamic space reclamation and only supports string data.
See method xbDbf::SetVersion for controlling which version type you are 
using.

<br><br>
To utilize memo fields, the application program must allocate a buffer 
which is large enough to handle the memo data.<br><br>

<h3>Fields and Field Numbers</h3>

The Xbase routines can access field data via using field names or field 
numbers.  Field numbers are numbered 0-n  where the first field in a datafile
is field 0 going through the last field n.  Accessing fields by number is 
slightly more efficient than accessing by name.<br><br>

<h3>Strings</h3>

Xbase64 includes support for a string class <em>xbString</em>.  
The xbString class interface was originally derived from the 
<em>Draft Standard C++ Library by P.J. Plauger</em> and modified.  
If you are familiar with other string classes, this one should be similar.  
Strings can be used to manage strings of character data.
<br><br>

<h3>Date Fields</h3>

All dates are stored in the .DBF files as Gregorian dates with format CCYYMMDD.<br><br>
The library date routines work with dates formated with the same CCYYMMDD format.<br><br>

<h3>Null Dates</h3>
Date fields in the database stored as eight spaces are considered null dates.<br><br>

<h3>Leap Years</h3>
 
A leap year is a year having 366 days, which can be evenly
divisible by 4 and not by 100 or divisible by 400. There are also leap centuries.  
Leap centuries are years which are evenly divisible by 400.

<h3>Julian Dates</h3>
   
The Julian date routines calculate a Julian date as the number of days
since 01/01/0001 with an offset of 1721425L.  
<br><br>
   
Julian dates are useful for doing date arithmetic such as determining the 
difference between two dates or calculating a future or past date.<br><br>
        
To determine the difference between two dates,  convert both dates to a 
Julian date and subtract one from the other.<br><br>

To calculate a future or past date, convert the base date to a Julian date,
add (or subtract) the number of days necessary to (from) it and convert the
Julian date back to a Gregorian date.<br><br>
