Xbase64  (Sept 15, 2003)
------------------------

Xbase64 was branched off the xbase C++ class lib project and given a new name.

There are significant changes in this release.

1)  The original author (Gary Kunkel) has resumed working on the project.

2)  The project was branched and renamed to xbase64 with 64 bit file 
    processing capabilities.  The xbase name is being used by other projects,
    so I thought it was time for a new name.

3)  Modified the license from LGPL to GPL as recommended by the GNU web site.
    Files that I have not been able to get permission from the original 
    author for GPL terms have beed deleted from the library.

4)  Trimmed the tree: Dropped support for the xbHtml class, the turbo vision 
    interface, and the ybase directory.  These are either unused, not working,
    undocumented, not maintained, or I didn't have authority to change the 
    license from LGPL to GPL. 

5)  Didn't move make files forward that were not documented or working.
    These need to be reviewed and brought forward.

6)  Worked on the locking logic. 

7)  Added support for Borland C++ 5.x compiler.

8)  Created a new data type of XB_BOOL.  Current bool data type was causing
    issues in certain environments.

9)  Dropped support for XB_CASTELLANO dates.  Changed the logic to use
    system locale settings, this supports descriptive dates in different
    languages.

10) Cleaned up memory leaks.

11) Updates to the documentation.

12) Enhancements to the expression logic

13) Fixed the broken index logic - the ndx and ntx indices are working 
    again.

xbase library.
